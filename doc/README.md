# Usage Alternatives

More alternatives are available to run the project, simply buy running containers one at a time, the first using *Docker Compose* and the second running *bash scripts (.sh)* located in the bin/ directory.

## Docker Compose
To run a single container execute the following command followed by the container name (available inside *docker-compose.yml*):
```
docker-compose up <container_name>
```

## Scripts
As previously mentioned, have a look inside the **bin/** for more details on the correct usage.
